/// **Single-rule semantics.** At most one ``.script`` and at most one
/// ``.streamScript`` fire on a given message; when several rules of the
/// same kind match the request's URL, the last in rule order wins.
///
/// Capping at one rule per kind keeps the hot path lean — no chain
/// orchestration, no repeated Swift↔JS ctx round-trips per rule, no
/// intermediate message copies — and rules out a state-collision hazard
/// a chain would create: ``Anywhere.store`` keys are scoped to the rule
/// set (not the rule), and the per-stream ``FrameCursor.state`` slot is
/// single-valued, so two scripts chained on the same URL would stomp
/// each other's persistent state on every frame. Authors who need
/// composed behaviour should consolidate logic into a single
/// `process(ctx)` function.
