/// Applies the script subset of a compiled rule list to a buffered,
/// decompressed HTTP message. The HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 rewriters share
/// this entry point so the rule-application loop lives in one place.
///
/// **Single-rule semantics — by design, not a limitation.** At most
/// one ``.script`` and at most one ``.streamScript`` may fire on a
/// given message. When multiple rules of the same kind match the
/// in-flight Content-Type, the last one in rule order wins — later
/// definitions overwrite earlier ones.
///
/// Capping the script chain at one rule per kind is a deliberate
/// design choice to maximize performance and efficiency, not a
/// missing feature. It keeps the hot path lean — no chain
/// orchestration, no repeated Swift↔JS ctx round-trips per rule, no
/// intermediate message copies between rules — and rules out
/// state-collision hazards a chain would create: the JS engine's
/// ``Anywhere.store`` keys are scoped to the rule set (not the rule),
/// and the per-stream ``FrameCursor.state`` slot for ``streamScript``
/// is single-valued, so chaining two scripts on the same content type
/// would have them stomping each other's persistent state on every
/// frame. Authors who need composed behaviour should consolidate
/// logic into a single `process(ctx)` function rather than splitting
/// across multiple rules.
///
/// Each script rule carries its own ``BodyContentTypeFilter``; the
/// message's `Content-Type` is checked at the entry point so rules
/// whose filter doesn't match the in-flight payload are skipped
/// without entering the JS engine.
