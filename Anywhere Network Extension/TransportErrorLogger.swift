/// Logging policy
/// ==============
/// - Connection failures (TCP connect/send/receive, UDP connect/receive) are
///   terminal events. The user-facing connection (``TCPConnection`` /
///   ``UDPFlow``) owns a ``ConnectionFailureReporter`` that logs them
///   exactly once.
/// - Non-terminal send failures (UDP datagram drops, control-frame sends on a
///   still-alive transport) use ``logTransientSend`` and log at warning level.
/// - Inner transport / session / handshake layers must not call
///   ``AnywhereLogger.error`` directly. They propagate errors via
///   `Result`/`Error`; the LWIP boundary logs once.
