///
/// - **TCP/ICMP** → ``lwipQueue``, fed into the vendored lwIP stack (which is
///   not thread-safe, hence the single serial queue).
/// - **UDP** → ``udpQueue``. lwIP is built TCP-only (`LWIP_UDP 0`), so UDP is
///   parsed, routed, NATed, and proxied entirely in Swift (``UDPPacket`` /
///   ``UDPFlow`` / `TunnelStack+UDP`) without ever entering lwIP — and so
///   without contending on ``lwipQueue``.

/// responses back to the packet flow via the shared, lock-guarded output buffer.
