/// Closure-based transport adapter used by ``WebSocketConnection``,
/// ``HTTPUpgradeConnection``, and ``XHTTPConnection``.
///
/// These protocols ride on top of different underlying transports — a plain
/// TCP socket, a TLS record connection, or a tunneled proxy chain — each of
/// which exposes a slightly different `send`/`receive`/`cancel` API.
/// Wrapping the transport in a fixed closure triple lets the higher-level
/// protocol stay transport-agnostic without introducing a protocol witness
/// table or forcing every transport to conform to a shared interface.
///
/// Construct with one of the `init(rawTCP:)` / `init(tls:)` / `init(tunnel:)`
/// factories; the raw memberwise init remains available for call sites that
/// need to synthesize closures (e.g. upload transports built at dial time).
