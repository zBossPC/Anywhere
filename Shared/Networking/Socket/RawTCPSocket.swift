// MARK: - RawTCPSocket

/// A TCP transport using BSD (POSIX) sockets with asynchronous I/O.
/// All callers reach this through the ``RawTransport`` protocol.
///
/// ### DNS
/// DNS resolution is performed via ``DNSResolver`` to avoid tunnel routing
/// loops, and the resolved IP address strings are fed directly into the socket
/// via `inet_pton`. This bypasses the system resolver at connect time.
///
/// ### Socket Options (match Xray-core `sockopt_darwin.go`)
/// - `O_NONBLOCK`     — non-blocking socket for async I/O via DispatchSource.
/// - `SO_NOSIGPIPE`   — prevents SIGPIPE on write to a broken pipe (Darwin-specific).
/// - `TCP_NODELAY`    — disables Nagle's algorithm.
/// - `SO_KEEPALIVE`   — enables TCP keepalive.
/// - `TCP_KEEPALIVE`  — idle seconds before the first probe (Darwin name; Linux is TCP_KEEPIDLE).
/// - `TCP_KEEPINTVL`  — interval between probes.
/// - `TCP_KEEPCNT`    — number of failed probes before the kernel drops the connection.
///
/// ### Threading
/// All socket I/O and state-machine transitions are serialized on an internal
/// serial dispatch queue (`ioQueue`). All DispatchSources (read/write/timer)
/// are bound to that queue, so their handlers are implicitly serialized
/// against each other. The `state` property is additionally protected by an
/// unfair lock so that `isTransportReady` and `forceCancel()` can be called
/// safely from any thread without deadlocking on `ioQueue`. `forceCancel()`
/// synchronously latches the cancelled state and then dispatches teardown to
/// `ioQueue`; any blocks already pending on the queue re-check state and bail
/// out.
///
/// ### Loopback
/// Inside a `NEPacketTunnelProvider`, the provider's own socket traffic is
/// kernel-excluded from the tunnel, so a direct `connect(2)` here does not
/// loop back. Loopback targets (127.0.0.0/8, ::1) are always routed via
/// `lo0`. No explicit interface binding — we rely on the OS routing table
/// plus the kernel-level NE bypass.
///
/// ### `initialData`
/// When provided, `initialData` is eagerly enqueued on the send buffer as
/// soon as connect completes. No kernel TFO (`connectx`) — we trade one
/// RTT in the best case for a simpler non-blocking connect flow. Callers
/// (TLS ClientHello, Reality ClientHello) stay correct because the first
/// `receive` still waits on the server's response.
